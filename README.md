# SQL_Project
This repository features an SQL project designed to demonstrate my expertise in database management, data analysis, and querying medium to large datasets. This project highlights my ability to optimize queries and derive actionable insights, showcasing my proficiency in relational databases.

# Restaurant Order Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes restaurant order data to identify the most and least popular menu items and their respective cuisines. Designed for beginners, this project demonstrates foundational SQL concepts, providing a solid base for tackling more complex database challenges in the future.

## How to Use This Repository
### Option 1: Run SQL Scripts
1. Execute the following scripts in your SQL editor:
   - 'Restaurant_menu_items_Script.sql'
   - 'Restaurant_menu_order_details_Script.sql'
2. These scripts will create and populate the necessary tables ('menu_items' and 'order_details') with data.  

Note: If you’re not using MySQL, you may need to comment out or modify USE statements or other MySQL-specific syntax for compatibility with your SQL editor.

### Option 2: Load Data from CSV
1. Use your SQL editor's graphical user interface (GUI) to import the data from 'restaurant_db_data_dictionary.csv'.  
2. Create the tables manually if required and import the CSV data to start working on the queries.

## Disclaimer
The dataset was sourced from [Maven Analytics](https://app.mavenanalytics.io/guided-projects/d7167b45-6317-49c9-b2bb-42e2a9e9c0bc), and accompanying video tutorials are available on YouTube by Maven Analytics. However, the queries and analysis presented here are my original work, crafted to enhance my analytical and SQL skills.
